# StringOps with Spring/Java/JavaScript

### Overview
This lab is intended to build on concepts from PBL and CB.  This will require stringing together concepts from the year.

1. Pull code and analyze.  Get started on Activities for Extra Credit.  Work as a Team.
2. Controller Key elements (stringEvent, allows events to be added through api request)
   -- Activity, add a new string event (split to make a list from string), get it to work between "control" and "model" using provided tester--
3. Add FrontEnd code for Split Use case
   -- Activity, add split dialog and have user specifify deliter (<space> or comma), update Model and Control testers to support action --


### Control Topics
* Java Switch Statements
* RequestEntity, ResponseEntity
* Control tester (static methods)
### Model Topics
* Java String Methods
* Java List, ArrayList
* FRQ2
* Model tester (static methods)
### View Topics
* Thymeleaf work with Java Objects
* JavaScript API fetch and response

### Future Mini-lab Ideas
1. Build StringOps into your Scrum Team project, the Team section for execution.
2. Build MVC solution in Individual Areas for FRQ2.
3. Establish plan for Team or individuals to complete MVC solution each week, perhaps on rotation.
