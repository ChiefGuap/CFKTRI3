# StringOps with Spring/Java/JavaScript

### Overview
This lab is intended to build on concepts from PBL and CB.  This in class challenge will use topics that require "stringing" together concepts from the 1st half of the year.

1. Pull code and analyze.  Get started on Activities for Extra Credit.  Work as a Team.
2. Model method (given a string and a delimiter return List<>)
   -- Actvity, add method and incorporate into "model" tester
3. Controller add "split" action (give the action "split" and delimter "<space> or ," then invoke model method)
   -- Activity, add a new "split" event, get it to work between "control" and "model" using the provided control tester--
4. Add FrontEnd code for Split use case
   -- Activity (part 1), add split option to frontend and have user specifify deliter (<space> or comma)
   -- Activity (part 2), update Model and Control testers to support split action and show as functional --


### Control Topics
* Java Switch Statements
* RequestEntity, ResponseEntity
* Control tester (static methods)
### Model Topics
* Java String Methods
* Java List, ArrayList
* FRQ2
* Model tester (static methods)
### View Topics
* Thymeleaf work with Java Objects
* JavaScript API fetch and response

### Future Mini-lab Ideas
1. Build StringOps into your Scrum Team project, the Team section for execution.
2. Build MVC solution into Individual Areas for FRQ2.
3. Establish plan for Team or individuals to complete MVC solution each week, perhaps on rotation.
