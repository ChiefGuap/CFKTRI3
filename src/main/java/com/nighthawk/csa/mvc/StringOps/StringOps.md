# StringOps with Spring/Java/JavaScript

### Overview
This lab is intended to build on concepts from PBL and CB.  This in class challenge will use topics that require "stringing" together concepts from the 1st half of the year.

1. Pull code and analyze.  Get started on Activities for Extra Credit.  Work as a Team, think of design and work split before coding.
2. Model method (with the managed String Sequenc and a split delimiter return a List of Strings)
   -- Actvity, add method and incorporate into "model" tester
3. Controller add a "split" action (given the action "split" and a delimter "<space> or ," invoke model method)
   -- Activity, add a new "split" event, get it to work between "control" and "model" and incorporate into the control tester--
4. Add FrontEnd code for "split" use case, this should be considered as a result that is updated like the String Sequence  
   -- Activity, add split delimiter as input (<space> or comma), perhaps you could smart calculate it by default, consider placement and design so it seems logical.

### Control Topics
* Java Switch Statements
* RequestEntity, ResponseEntity
* Control tester (static methods)
### Model Topics
* Java String Methods
* Java List, ArrayList
* College Board CSA FRQ2
* Model tester (static methods)
### View Topics
* Thymeleaf work with Java Objects
* JavaScript API fetch and response

### Future Mini-lab Ideas
1. Build StringOps into your Scrum Team project and/or individual project, be sure to highlight a portion for the FRQ2 solutions.
2. Establish plan for Team or individuals to complete MVC solution each week, perhaps on rotation in Scrum Board.  Quality needs to improve on many for me to consider work to be A or B quality.
3. String Ops could be used to build a messaging system between discrete systems, in a true *LightSequence GradShow* demonstration a series of commands or binary bits could be used to play the show.  In the case of an Inventors List, such a sequence could be used to look up and iterate through a series page updates and provide an *Inventors show*.  The inventors could be looked up through database records or APIs.  In either case, validation could be done on Adminstration screen, followed by a play action.
